# Issues with Dual Writes

<v-clicks>

- Database transaction successful - write to ES failed
- Database transaction rolled back - write to ES succeeded

</v-clicks>

<!--
 Could add commit listener, retry etc  
 Not ideal - hard to solve all cases properly

# Alternatives

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Distributed transaction
  - Lack of support (Elasticsearch, Kafka,...)
  - Slow

</v-clicks>


<!--
  No silver bullet either  
  Not supported by data stores  
  Single point of failure  
  Might need additional transaction manager

# Debezium

<v-clicks>

- Open source change data capture platform
- Uses Kafka for event storage/distribution

</v-clicks>

# Basic idea

<v-clicks>

- Parse transaction log
- Publish events to a message broker (Kafka)

</v-clicks>

<!--
  Transaction log: foundation of modern database system  
  Each action executed recorded in log
  Turning the database inside out  
  Low level construct (log) -> API for consuming it

  Provides the D in ACID  
  ARIES for recovery algorithm
