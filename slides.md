# Issues with Dual Writes

<v-clicks>

- Database transaction successful - write to ES failed
- Database transaction rolled back - write to ES succeeded
- Ordering issues

</v-clicks>

<!--
 Could add commit listener, retry etc  
 Not ideal - hard to solve all cases properly

# Alternatives

<v-clicks depth="2">

- Distributed transaction
  - Slow
  - Lack of support (Elasticsearch, Kafka,...)
- Patterns
  - Outbox
  - Saga
- CDC tools

</v-clicks>


<!--
  Synchronization between participants: performance overhead  
  Not supported by data stores  
  Support for Kafka will be added (currently in development)  
  But the offer strong consistency guarantees  
  
  Patterns might help avoid dual-writes as well but deserve an extra talk.  
  Saga (undo/compensating actions), Outbox (write to additional table in same transaction)

# Basic idea

<v-clicks>

- Parse transaction log
- Transform into usable event
- Publish events to a message broker (Kafka)
- Consume event from message broker

</v-clicks>

<!--
  Transaction log: foundation of modern database system  
  Each action executed recorded in log
  Turning the database inside out  
  Low level construct (log) -> API for consuming it

  Provides the D in ACID  
  ARIES for recovery algorithm

# Debezium

<v-clicks>

- Open source change data capture platform
- Uses Kafka for event storage/distribution

# Summary

### Advantages

<br/>
<v-clicks>

- Robustness
- Scalability
- No modification of application code needed
- Additional data stores can be added easily

</v-clicks>

<!--
  More robust than hand crafted solution  
  Tested by the community  
  Application does not need to know anything about it (legacy modernization)  
  Add more data stores easily - simply consume events somewhere else

# Summary

### Disadvantages 

<br/>
<v-clicks>

- Complexity
- More components to maintain
- Another tool to learn

</v-clicks>


<!--
  No silver bullet either  
  More components to maintain (infrastructure)/cost
  Another tool to learn etc.
